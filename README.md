Orbodoro-Timer!

Functions just like a regular Pomodoro-Timer but has an exciting twist
where users will be more engage with study, and that will be achieved by
introduce a reward system after every Eggodoro study session!

Rewards will include incubating eggs as long as the Eggodoro study session
carries on for. A successful incubation will result in new backgrounds, music
and mini-mascots to customize your Orbodoro interface - But be careful though,
constantly pausing the timer may result in no prize at all!
